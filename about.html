				<h1>Monkey Pox</h1>
				<p class="truncated">
					Mpox / Monkey Pox is a disease caused by a virus. It usually causes a
					rash and flu-like symptoms.
				</p>
				<div id="monkeypox-details" class="details-container hidden">
					<h2>Symptoms</h2>
					<p>
						The symptoms of mpox include a rash with skin ulcers or blisters,
						fever, swollen lymph nodes, chills, headache, muscle aches, and
						fatigue.
					</p>
					<h2>What does mpox rash look like?</h2>
					<p>
						Usually begins as flat red spots (that can look like pimples or heat
						rash), which turn into blisters and then form a crust.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you get mpox?</h2>
					<p>
						Mpox spreads through direct contact with infected sores, scabs, or
						bodily fluids such as saliva, mucus, blood, or other secretions from
						an infected person or animal. It can also be transmitted by coming
						into contact with contaminated materials like clothing, bedding, or
						towels. Additionally, vertical transmission can occur when a
						pregnant person passes the virus to their fetus during pregnancy or
						childbirth.

				<h1>Chickenpox</h1>
				<p class="truncated">
					Chickenpox is an infection of a virus called varicella-zoster that
					causes an itchy, blister-like skin rash.
				</p>
				<div id="chickenpox-details" class="details-container hidden">
					<h2>Symptoms</h2>
					<p>
						The symptoms include a low-grade fever, tiredness, headache, and a
						stomachache that reduces appetite. The characteristic itchy skin
						rash consists of small blisters filled with milky fluid, which
						eventually break and form scabs. The rash may appear blotchy, and
						the scabs eventually crust over and fade away.
					</p>
					<h2>What does chickenpox rash look like?</h2>
					<p>
						The three stages of chickenpox describe the progression of the rash.
						In Stage 1, a red, bumpy rash appears, lasting for a few days.
						During Stage 2, the rash develops into fluid-filled blisters, which
						typically break open after one to two days. Finally, in Stage 3, the
						blisters scab over, and this stage also lasts a few days.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you get chicken pox?</h2>
					<p>
						Chickenpox spreads through direct contact with someone who has the
						virus, inhaling air containing droplets from an infected person's
						sneeze or cough, and coming into contact with fluids from an
						infected person's eyes, nose, or mouth.

				<h1>Measles</h1>
				<p class="truncated">
					Measles (rubeola) is a disease that causes fever and a rash.
				</p>
				<div id="measles-details" class="details-container hidden">
					<h2>Symptoms</h2>
					<p>
						The most common measles symptoms include a high fever, tiredness, a
						barky cough, red or bloodshot eyes, and a runny nose.
					</p>
					<h2>What does the measles rash looks like?</h2>
					<p>
						The rash starts out as flat red spots on your face and then moves
						downward to cover your whole body. Then, smaller raised white spots
						may appear on top of the red rash. The spots might join together as
						the rash goes down your body.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you get measles?</h2>
					<p>
						It's highly contagious and spreads through the air when a person
						with measles talks, coughs or sneezes.

			<!-- HFMD -->
			<div class="about-container card" onclick="toggleDetails('hfmd-details')">
				<h1>HFMD</h1>
				<p class="truncated">
					HFMD is a disease with blister-like rash that forms on child's hands
					and feet and painful sores that develop in their mouth.
				</p>
				<div id="hfmd-details" class="details-container hidden">
					<h2>Symptoms</h2>
					<p>
						Hand, foot, and mouth disease symptoms typically appear in two
						stages. In the initial stage, your child may experience flu-like
						symptoms, including a mild fever, sore throat, runny nose,
						stomachache, and loss of appetite.
					</p>
					<h2>What does the HFMD rash looks like?</h2>
					<p>
						Small red spots or blisters often starting in the mouth then hands
						and feet.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you get HFMD?</h2>
					<p>
						Hand, foot, and mouth disease is highly contagious and spreads
						through airborne droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs.
						It can also spread through contact with an infected person's saliva
						or stool, followed by touching your mouth, eyes, or nose. Direct
						contact with an infected person's blisters, kissing or hugging
						someone with the virus, and sharing eating utensils, cups, towels,
						or clothing also increase the risk. Additionally, touching
						contaminated toys, surfaces, doorknobs, or other items and then
						touching your eyes, nose, or mouth can lead to transmission.

			<!-- Cowpox -->
			<div

				<h1>Cowpox</h1>
				<p class="truncated">
					Cowpox is a rare zoonotic infection caused by a DNA orthopoxvirus that
					is similar to the vaccinia and smallpox viruses.
				</p>
				<div id="cowpox-details" class="details-container hidden">
					<h2>Symptoms</h2>
					<p>
						Symptoms include fatigue, flu, headache, malaise, and regional
						lymphadenopathy.
					</p>
					<h2>What does the cowpox rash looks like?</h2>
					<p>
						The cowpox rash typically begins as small, red spots that develop
						into raised, fluid-filled blisters or pustules. These lesions
						usually appear on the hands, arms, or face, but they can spread to
						other parts of the body. Over time, the blisters form scabs that
						eventually fall off as the skin heals. The rash may be accompanied
						by mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes.
						The lesions are usually less severe than those of smallpox and may
						not be as widespread.
					</p>
					<h2>How do you get cowpox?</h2>
					<p>
						Cowpox primarily spreads through direct contact with infected
						animals, particularly cows, although other animals like rodents and
						cats can also carry the virus. Humans can contract cowpox by
						handling infected animals or their contaminated materials, such as
						fur, skin, or saliva. The virus can enter through broken skin or
						mucous membranes. Additionally, human-to-human transmission is
						possible through contact with infected lesions or bodily fluids,
						although this is less common. The risk of transmission is typically
						higher in settings where people have close contact with animals that
						may carry the virus.
