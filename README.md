# DermaVision AI
This project is designed as a tool to assist users in identifying skin diseases by analyzing uploaded images. Upon submitting a picture, the system provides feedback on the diagnosed condition and, in cases where the disease is classified as mpox, also evaluate its severity level.

## 2 Installation
### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sfu-cmpt340/2024_3_project_08.git
cd 2024_3_project_08
```

### 2. Set Up environment

Install the required Python dependencies: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the dataset

- Go to the source  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset/data (Nafin, n.d.).
- Download the dataset by executing the provided code in a standalone .py file (Note: Make sure you don't download the dataset as zip as it messes up the pathway of the inner files).
- The folder's path will be displayed in the terminal. Relocate it to './src/mpox/.'
- Ensure that the file path './src/mpox/mpox-skin-lesion-dataset-version-20-msld-v20/versions/4' exists.
- Download the classified dataset. Original data is retrieved from the same dataset as above (Nafin, n.d.). https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nbV4X2f4PvFahuJbwLZc9pmFaODSSN7j/view?usp=sharing 
- Extract and relocate the file to './src/severity/'
- Ensure that the file path './src/severity/classifiedData' exists.

### 4. Augment data
```bash
cd src/severity
python 1_keras_augmentation.py
```
### 5. Extract features from data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
```bash
cd src/severity
python 2_pca.py
```
### 6. Train the first model
```bash
cd src/mpox
python src/mpox/train.py
```

#### key features:
- Train the model using 5-fold cross validation
- Save the model as 'final_cnn_model.keras'

This will generate a model file in the src/mpox/models directory.


This step will take approximately an hour to complete. Alternatively, you can access the data generated by the model through this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzZ5aBODV9wzLW3VAQFYr-EGx6x-ru-t/view?usp=sharing  


If you decide to download the data, remember to unzip the file and relocate the “my_dir” folder and the file named “final_cnn_model.keras” inside the root directory “2024_3_PROJECT_08”. 

### 7. Train the second model
```bash
cd src/severity
python src/mpox/3_1_train_pca_rf.py
```

### 8. (Optional) Test the model
To evaluate the model's performance:


Part 1: Skin diseases Classification
```bash
cd src/mpox
python src/mpox/train.py
``` 

Part 2: Stage Classification

Add image data to the file located at ./src/stages/test_data and run the following command:
```bash
cd src/severity
python src/mpox/3_2_test_pca_rf.py
```

### Requirements
All requirements will be installed requirements.txt
- Python 3.8+
- VSCode 
- Required packages:
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
  - Flask
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Jobliv
